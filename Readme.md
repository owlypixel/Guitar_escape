## What is this?
Welcome to the Owlypixel's guitar escape!
When I was in high school, I was obsessed with guitar. During those times I took some classic guitar classes, and to measure my progress recorded myself with my old tape recorder. Due to the fact that old analog tape is not a very reliable medium, I decided to digitize my old recordings.
So, without further ado, let me take you on a journey to a land of old memories, constantly hurting fingers, jolly improvisation, strict discipline and remarkable power of music.
You can listen to all compositions [here](https://codepen.io/owlypixel/project/full/AprkOz/) on CodePen.
